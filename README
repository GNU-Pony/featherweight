A lightweight news syndication aggregator for your terminal shell.


Featherweight is designed to pull down the latest news as a cron job,
and be browsed in your terminal. Due to it running as a cron job you are
able to display the number of new news in your shell prompt line (PS1)
and not have an application constantly open in the background.
