There are glitches when closing nodes on the tree.

Branches with no unread entries should be closed
when a tree is firsted opened.

'n'-key should make a jump to the next unread message.

Ctrl+down is strange when at the last node.

Improve use of flock.

Backup all files before editing them.

Do not use html2text, it sucks.

It should be possible to reorder feeds.
